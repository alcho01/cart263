Project 1 - A Night at the Movies
Due Feb 15 - Feb 22

Quick Note - I hope this doesn't affect the aesthetic. The canvas is made to be 800 x 1000. Hopefully it doesn't look squashed on other screens. 

Artist Statement

Why did I choose Get Out?

I'm not a big movie fan, but I enjoy movies where there is a need to dig for the meaning. Get Out has to be one of my favourite movies that I've ever seen. The subtle symbols used to represent race and class are what stood out for me.


What I was going for.

I did not want this to be so much just point and click. I wanted the user to experience the environment by walking in the first person. I also did not want it to feel like a game. The purpose was to make it feel more like an experience where the interaction is there, but it is not meant to be difficult. Also, keep in mind that this is a re-imagination of the plot for the film. Not everything I included is exactly how it pans out in the movie.

I am most happy with how the sunken place turned out. When the dialogue is done, it transitions to the sunken place where the speed/duration/amplitude of sound and visuals can change depending on the user. I think it is an innovative idea and probably what I am most proud of.

I included p5.sound by complementing the particle system I created with the audio for the sunken place.

I included responsive voice multiple times. Once for the radio, and once when it asks for the password.

The last library I used was Annyang. It is required when the user states the password.


Biggest Challenge.

The biggest challenge I had for this project was if I could tie all my ideas together in a cohesive manner. I wanted to compress the plot of Get Out for my project. I believe I succeeded for the most part. However, I still had a few elements that I did not have enough time to implement.  


Breakdown of the simulation.

Starts off at the pretitle, continue to the title, continue to the instructions.

The user starts outside, has to use the "A" Key to get close enough to the door.

Once inside the user can navigate around with A, D, W, S keys.

The first accessible place is the living room (Room on the left). The user can click on the chair to prompt a sequence of cutscenes.

Once the cutscenes are complete it will transition the user to the Sunken Place. Use keys 1, 2, 3 to change the tempo and aesthetics. 1 being the slowest, 3 being the fastest.

The user wakes up in the bedroom. Click the radio to hear the secret code. If you forget to click the radio, you can go back up the stairs.

Go to the blue speaker on the wall. It is going to ask for the secret code which is "rotten". Speak into your microphone to unlocked the basement door.

Walk through the basement hallway.

Once you are in the basement, click the tv. Then click the play button on the tv.

A cutscene of another form of hypnosis is taken place. Talking about what the family is about.

The Coagula is the blob that is hypnotizing the user. You can increase or decrease the size with the up and down arrow keys but it is meant for visual purposes mostly.

Once the narration is done, it will transition to the user trying to escape from the shackles. Follow the instructions to break free.

Ends with the credits.

Artist Statement

Why did I choose Get Out?
I'm not a big movie fan, but I enjoy movies where there is a need to dig for the meaning. Get Out has to be one of my favourite movies that I've ever seen. The subtle symbols used to represent race and class are what stood out for me.


What I was going for.
I did not want this to be so much just point and click. I wanted the user to experience the environment by walking in the first person. I also did not want it to feel like a game. The purpose was to make it feel more like an experience where the interaction is there, but it is not meant to be difficult. Also, keep in mind that this is a re-imagination of the plot for the film. Not everything I included is exactly how it pans out in the movie.

I am most happy with how the sunken place turned out. When the dialogue is done, it transitions to the sunken place where the speed/duration/amplitude of sound and visuals can change depending on the user. I think it is an innovative idea and probably what I am most proud of.

I included p5.sound by complementing the particle system I created with the audio for the sunken place.

I included responsive voice multiple times. Once for the radio, and once when it asks for the password.

The last library I used was Annyang. It is required when the user states the password.


Biggest Challenge.
The biggest challenge I had for this project was if I could tie all my ideas together in a cohesive manner. I wanted to compress the plot of Get Out for my project. I believe I succeeded for the most part. However, I still had a few elements that I did not have enough time to implement.  


Controls.
W, A, S, D - USER MOVEMENT
MOUSE - INTERACT WITH OBJECTS
SPACEBAR - SCROLL THROUGH CUTSCENES
ESC - EXIT OUT OF CERTAIN SCENES
1, 2, 3 - CHANGE SPEED OF SUNKEN PLACE
UP, DOWN KEY - CHANGE SIZE OF COAGULA

# DISTRACTIONS - BY ALEX CHO
---
### INTRODUCTION OF PROJECT

First off, although I didn't attend class much this semester, I really enjoyed this class because it positively tested my creativity, especially this final project. As stated before in my proposal, this project deals with my personal experience with addiction. While developing the final product, I had a random realization that programming to me was an outlet and a good distraction from a stressful day or my urge to gamble. Therefore, I wanted to be ambitious and tell a story that has similarities to my personal experience.

The game follows a young adult named Brian coping with his mother's addiction and sudden death. The goal of the game is to complete all the tasks. The tasks are repetitive to reflect the idea of addiction. They are also abstract in the sense that these tasks are very random and don't make much sense. Ultimately, they serve as a distraction for the protagonist. There is also more of a story-based element when the user collects the notes scattered throughout each location. Each note provides a backstory and insight into the protagonist's family life. The storyline takes place over several days. Going from one place to another is considered a new day.

### TECHNIQUES / LIBRARIES

I knew right away that P5.JS was the main library that I was going to use for my final project. It is a library that enables the exploration of many creative avenues. Also, it is my favourite library that I learned from in both semesters. Annyang was the secondary library utilized. I didn't use Annyang as much as P5JS. I would have used it more, but I feel it is limited in its capabilities and is not always accurate. I used libraries that we learned early on in the semester, the only reason being I wanted to dedicate a lot of time to the project. As a result, I was able to start brainstorming early on, and I wasn't as comfortable with libraries introduced in the later half of the semester because I didn't spend as much time on them.

If it wasn't noticeable from my previous projects and this project, I am a big fan of object-oriented programming. It keeps things organized and easy for me to find. I could have gone even further to put certain elements from a specific task into their own classes. However, I decided not to go down that path because I thought the way I did it was still clear enough.

### USER EXPERIENCE

The game is meant to be serious. I want to convey the message that addiction causes for a dysfunctional dynamic within families and is dangerous no matter what type of addiction it is. That being said, some of the tasks may be challenging, while other tasks may be easy. It relies on the user's understanding of the abstractness of the tasks and how the mechanics work.

### CHALLENGE

The biggest challenge would have to be thinking about what the tasks will be and how they will work. I spent a lot of time looking through the P5 reference page to gather ideas. Implementing my thoughts was easier than coming up with them.

### IMPROVEMENTS / MY OPINION

I fall into the habit of creating repetitive code, which is not the greatest habit, but one I lean on because I know that the code will still work. I also don't create enough parent classes. I keep extending from the same class. Again, another bad habit. However, I am pretty happy with the final result of this project. I think it demonstrates my progression as a programmer. For each project I created, I wanted the next one to be better than the previous one, and I think I accomplished that.

Overall, the program does everything I envisioned it to do. Therefore, from a technical standpoint, I met my expectations. From an artistic standpoint, I am pleased with the look, and the way tasks follow a simple aesthetic contrasted with more complex or unorthodox mechanics like quickly moving the mouse up and down.

### TIMELINE OF STORY / PLOT

Brian is speaking to his mother on the phone.

Opening scene contains cinematic footage of Brian's house deep within the forest.

Mom sending notes about having to delay the trip back home.

Linda sends a note mentioning Brian's mother's addiction. Which has delayed the process of coming home.

Brian receiving the news from Linda that his mom passed away in a car accident.

All the above notes are sent, while Brian is trying to distract himself by doing the tasks.

His father picks him up in his car. They drive back to his father's.

Brian finds a book of notes exchanged between his father and mother.

From the notes the parents are trying to make amends and they feel bad for Brian.

The last note sent to Brian's father was his mother driving home that night to surprise Brian.

The cause of the accident is unknown.

Ends with the title displaying once more.

### TASK DESCRIPTION
***
#### HEART MONITOR

Difficulty - Intermediate

The heart monitor task involves the user to rapidly use the mouse and zig zag from top to bottom / bottom to top and reach the goal before times run out.
If time runs out, the progress bar will reset and force the user to start again.
The goal is 80 points. 2 points per "touch". The user has 10 seconds.
If the user successfully completes the task the stroke will turn green.

This information can be found in the journal along with a simple diagram.
---
#### LOGIC PAD

Difficulty - Hard
The goal of the game is to not get caught by the automated spec while being able to keep your attention on multiple events going on simultaneously for 35 seconds.
Use the mouse to control the platform.
Use the W-S key to control the user spec (Blue Spec).
The user should keep the red bouncing ball in play to keep reseting the slider handle.
The slider handle resets every time the red bouncing ball comes in contact with the platform.
The slider handle enables the movement of the user spec, therefore if the ball drops and the handle reaches the highest capacity there isn't anything the user can do, and will have to restart.
This task is about coordination and controlling multiple events at once.
For some this might be easy, for others it might be hard.

This information can be found in the journal along with a simple diagram.
---
#### CONFESSION

Difficulty - Easy (TO ME)
The goal of the game is to unscramble the words to formulate a sentence.
The user should start by clicking on the 4 nodes surrounding the orbit.
Each node will have letters to unscramble to form english words.
To unscramble the word use your voice to guess the answer, when the answer is correct the node will disappear.
Once all surrounding nodes are guessed correctly(Hidden), the user can click the center node to guess the final sentence.
When the final sentence is guessed correctly it will revert to the previous state.

This information can be found in the journal along with a simple diagram.
---
#### Detector

Difficulty - Easy to Intermediate

The goal of the task is to find the hidden target.
It is best to start with the radar system to approximate the hidden target's location.
A sound will go off notifying the user of the approximate location.
After the radar system is used, proceed with the closers.
The closers is utilized to locate the location more specifically with the already given intel from the radar system.
Once the closers line up correctly via the mouse position, two intersecting lines will display.
When they display, the user will need to click the intersecting point of the lines to complete the task.
A sound will go off and the user will be brought back to the previous state.

This information can be found in the journal along with a simple diagram.

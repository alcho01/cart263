Sad Sonnet Generator
Alex Cho

A decided to create a sad sonnet generator. I created each line by looking at previous written works. I am not sure why, but for some reason it is easier to write things related to sadness compared to happiness. 

I decided to change the idea from a haiku to a sonnet. I added more detail to the css, added a mouse hover through html, and implemented responsive voice.
Other than that I kept it pretty simple and minimalistic.

Exercise 4
Bubble Popper ++
Alex Cho

Didn't want to do a whole lot for this exercise considering it interferes with project time. Therefore, I kept the same aesthetic and incorporated small elements to make it a more complete game. I added a score counter, increased difficulty every time
the use hits an increment of 5 the speed of the bubbles gets a little faster. As well as sound, and a health system.

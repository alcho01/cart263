Exercise 3 - Medical Form

Alex Cho

Goal: Incorporating the use of JSON files, and loading previous data to be established for future use.

The theme of this exercise centers around the idea of a medical form.
Therefore, I added many new categories highlighting issues related to health.
There includes new forms of interactivity with the mouse and the keyboard, the mouse is used to generate a different profile on the date the user inputed,
while the delete key is used to erase the currently saved storage and generate a brand new profile, in a case the user forgets their username or password.

*Accidentally committed a part of project 1 with exercise 3.

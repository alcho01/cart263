Exercise 1 - Gem Hunt

It is the same concept as finding the sausage dog. I added my own flare to the exercise by changing the image set, adding audio, and making it grow when the diamond is found.
I also included a starting, and ending state, as well as the rules of the game.

I kept it simple to remind me of some of the basic concepts. I did not want to overcomplicate things and get frustrated for my first exercise. That time will come but I'm not ready for that yet.

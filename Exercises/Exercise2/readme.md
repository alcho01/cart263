To answer a question the user needs to start of by saying "What is" and then finish the clue. Do not say "The", or "A" because it won't recognize the answer.
When the user accumulates $7200 they win. (Basically answer every clue correctly)

It is a play on the gameshow Jeopardy!

I wanted to familiarize myself with these new libraries and do something completely different from the activity.
